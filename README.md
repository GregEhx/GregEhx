# About me
Heading the Translational Immunology & Leukemia group at the GIGA-I3: Hematology lab of the University of Liege in Belgium, I am an enthusiastic researcher in immunology, oncology, and bioinformatics. My primary focus is on studying immunity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to develop new immunotherapies that combat this type of blood cancer. In this regard, I am particularly interested in exploring MHC-I epitopes presented by AML cells. Additionally, I am committed to designing novel bioinformatic tools to analyze the immunopeptidome.

# Software development
BamQuery is a computational pipeline enabling the exhaustive capture of the RNA expression of any MHC-I peptide (8-11 aa) in any RNA-seq sample. It is extremely fast and useful to perform comparisons between normal and cancer cells to identify actionable tumor-specific antigens.
